# PhytoVision
**Vision-Based Plant Health & Stress Analysis**

## Overview
PhytoVision is a computer vision system for analyzing plant health using image-derived features. The project focuses on identifying visual biomarkers—such as color distribution, texture, and structural variation—that correlate with plant stress, disease, and environmental conditions.

The system is designed as an end-to-end ML pipeline, from image preprocessing and feature extraction to classification and evaluation.
